# Introduction

Welcome to the HealNow API! You can use our API to access HealNow API endpoints, which can help you to create a beautiful payments experience for pharmacies and their customers.

We currently only have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you when we have more language bindings supported you'll be able to switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN"
```


> Make sure to replace `JWT_TOKEN` with your own generated token.

HealNow uses JWT tokens to allow access to the API. You can register a new HealNow JWT secret key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

HealNow expects for the JWT secret key to be used to generate the signature of the JWT token for all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:


`Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>JWT_TOKEN</code> with your personal token.
